**IMPORTANT NOTE**

You are using an integration that is still in development. We expect bugs, and hope to be able to fix them soon. Please expect bugs as well.
This integration currently only supports the MySkoda API compatible with the MySkoda App.

We have no intention to support features not in the MySkoda App, for instance the Skoda Essentials app.

**Please search issues in https://github.com/skodaconnect/myskoda and https://github.com/skodaconnect/homeassistant-myskoda for duplicates or fixes before reporting a new issue.**

**Is this working in MySkoda app?***
Logout and login in the MySkoda app, preferably on Android.
Make sure that you have the latest app updates, sometimes there's new consent needed that will only show in latest app version.

**Latest working release**
If the problem started after updating to a new release, please state latest working release.

**Debug logs**
If applicable, add debug logs. Debug logs help us locate and fix a problem quicker

**Installation:**
 - Home Assistant variant: [e.g. Hass OS, Docker, Core, Supervised]
