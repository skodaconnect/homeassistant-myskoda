# MySkoda Integration for Skoda vehicles compatible with MySkoda-App.

MySkoda integration using the API that the MySkoda App uses.

**Status:** This project is a new implementation of a relatively new API. Consider this code alpha. 

Contributions are welcomed, both as issues, but more as pull requests :) 

Please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/t7az2hSJXq) and help development by providing feedback and details about the vehicles you are using.

## Translations

## Sending updates

To make sure updates end up in the car the way intended by the you, we throttle all equal changes to the car for 30s.
Simply put: You can change a setting in the car once every 30s, but you can change multiple settings in sequence.

So:
- If you change the seat-heating to on, you can immediately change the window-heating to on as well.
- If you change the seat-heating to on, you cannot turn it back off again for 30s

The requests will silently be ignored by HomeAssistant, so make sure you wait at least 30s before sending another request

## Enable debug logging

For comprehensive debug logging you can add this to your `<config dir>/configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    myskoda: debug
    myskoda.mqtt: debug
    myskoda.rest_api: debug
    custom_components.myskoda: debug
    custom_components.myskoda.climate: debug
    custom_components.myskoda.lock: debug
    custom_components.myskoda.device_tracker: debug
    custom_components.myskoda.switch: debug
    custom_components.myskoda.binary_sensor: debug
    custom_components.myskoda.sensor: debug
    custom_components.myskoda.number: debug
    custom_components.myskoda.image: debug
 ```

Pick any of the subjects from the example. If you want to enable full debugging, you only need **myskoda** and **custom_components.myskoda**.

- **myskoda:** Set the debug level for the MySkoda library. This handles all the communication with MySkoda.

- **myskoda.mqtt:** Set the debug level for the MQTT class of the MySkoda library. This handles the push-messages sent from MySkoda to the integration, notifying of changes to/in the car.

- **myskoda.rest_api:** Set the debug level for the REST API of the MySkoda library. This handles all the pull-messages the integration fetches from MySkoda.

- **custom_components.myskoda:** Set debug level for the custom component. The communication between hass and library.

- **custom_components.myskoda.XYZ** Sets debug level for individual entity types in the custom component.

## Customize polling interval

This integration does not poll at a set interval, instead when the last update has been a while, we request new information from MySkoda.
The reason for this is that cars emit a lot of events when they are operating, and we use these events to partially update the car information.

When the car is quiet for a period we call the **POLLING INTERVAL**, we will request a full update of the car.

By default, this POLLING INTERVAL is set to 30 minutes. You can tune this to anything between 1 and 1440 minutes (1 day) by filling in the desired value in
Integrations > MySkoda > Hubs > Select your account > Configure

## Disabling polling

You can disable polling completely and use automations to update the data from MySkoda. In order to do this, disable polling in the integration, and call the following action:

```yaml
action: homeassistant.update_entity
target:
  entity_id: device_tracker.skoda_4ever
```
